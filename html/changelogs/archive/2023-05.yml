  - refactor: Spiderlings are now basic mobs, report any complete weirdness/deviation
      from known behavior. They should be a lot more intelligent now though.
  - rscadd: AI Spiderlings are super fragile, but they're also super fast, especially
      when they get into a vent. Once they're in circulation, they could end up everywhere!
      Maybe in the armory, maybe in a locked closet in maintenance. Be sure to be
      vigilant and splat them whenever you can to save the station from a whole lotta
      heartache!

  Melbert:
  - bugfix: North Star's shields now regenerate integrity over time
  Ryll/Shaps:
  - balance: Holding someone at gunpoint now requires both the shooter and the victim
      to hold still for half a second before activating, so you can't hold-up people
      fleeing or fighting you. After that, it will briefly immobilize the both of
      you, 0.75 seconds if adjacent, or half that if you're two tiles away. Nuke ops
      are immune to the immobilization, since they're ready to die anyways.
  - balance: Holding someone up will immediately apply a 1.25x damage and wound multiplier,
      rather than waiting 2.5 seconds to hit 2x.
  - soundadd: Being held up will now make the victim play a sharp gasp sound, a la
      Metal Gear Solid.
  TaleStationBot:
  - bugfix: Bows will no longer randomly stop taking new arrows.
  - image: extinguisher cabinet has new sprites
  - rscadd: Crewmembers arriving very late will not always have time to finish their
      breakfast.
  - balance: Machines (such as ORM and Techfabs) will no longer unsync from Ore silos
      when it moves Z-level, instead it will prevent materials from being used, as
      if it was on hold.
  - refactor: Russian mobs are now subtypes of Syndicate basic mobs.

      build stage when their integrity reaches 0  i.e. destroyed

      now.

  - balance: Mimes can no longer write on paper without breaking their vow.
  - spellcheck: Fixed Nanotrasen being miscapitalized in traitor posters, a drink,
      the ethereal lore, and some photocopier paperwork
