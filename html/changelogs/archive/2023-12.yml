  - bugfix: Icebox chemistry lab shutters are controlled by the button in the chemistry
      lab and not in the pharmacy again.
  TaleStationBot:
  - balance: The Meat Hook will now "ground" you whenever you fire it out at someone.
      You get a very small immobilization every time you fire, which "upgrades" to
      a full immobilization whenever you actually hit an atom and start to drag it
      in.
  - bugfix: A chain should now show up as you drag in something with the meat hooks.

      by examining them.

      makes THEM guilty, allowing further attacks.
  - balance: More favor for converting someone to the honorbound rules
  - sound: Added human laughter to felinids
  - rscadd: Instead of punished sect healing people like the normal bibble- you take
      their burdens on instead!

  Chimpston, atlasle and aBlimpfox:
  - image: "added Cult Cove, Neon Flamingo and Slowdive bar signs\n/\U0001F191"
  Melbert:
  - rscadd: Falling down a z-level while standing now damages your legs rather than
      your entire body. This also means falling down multiple z-s may rarely break
      your legs.
  - rscadd: Felinids now land on their feet if they fall down a z-level while standing.
      This replaces the knockdown with a short slowdown, and also has the trade-off

  Rhials:
  - qol: Bar signs ordered from cargo will no longer be access-restricted.

  - rscdel: "Removed clonexadone.\n/\U0001F191"

      The star gazer now deals burn damage instead of clone damage.
  - bugfix: The health of mobs combo'd by a cosmic blade will now update correctly.

      you need to specifically start this chain of events through the new VV Dropdown

  - refactor: (Almost) all smoothed icons can now be edited in their pre cut forms
  - balance: most diseases can now be slowed, mitigated, and eventually cured through
      being well-fed, resting, and using spaceacillin. Curing diseases through this
      way will give you immunity if you experience them at their peak/maximum and
      aren't starving/malnourished when they cure.
  - balance: disease symptoms can be forestalled for up to 100 cycles with a declining
      chance of avoiding them over time using rest or spaceacillin.
  - balance: This does not apply to things like fungal TB; it does apply to healing
      viruses if you don't take care of yourself by staying fed and avoiding spaceacillin.
  - balance: disease can be cured through direct injection or ingestion of cured blood.
      However, curing disease in this way does not provide lasting immunity. You need
      to naturally beat the virus or get a vaccine for that.
  - balance: Wearing internals or using protective equipment while infected can limit
      the spread of respiratory illnesses from yourself to others. Contact transmission
      is still possible however.
  - balance: Medical Doctors now have roundstart virology access. Paramedics and coroners
      now get virology access on skeleton shift access. Virologists now have roundstart
      pharmacy access.

      and can always override other advanced diseases; they also have an extra bonus
      on their stealth stat to help make up for early outing without a bit more testing.
  - balance: biohazard lockers now also contain a syringe of spaceacillin (in line
      with the orderable kit from cargo.)
  - balance: Virus severity is now also a function of the number of symptoms out of
      max your virus has. Experiment with different combinations using less than six
      symptoms to make viruses that are deceptively less-obvious and less quick to
      self-cure at the tradeoff of stats.
  - rscadd: TGUI Stack elements can now be zebra-styled (alternating colors for contrast)
  - bugfix: Being revived inside a legion now sets you free
  - bugfix: "in some rare cases gib() did infact not spawn gib\n/\U0001F191"

      select other limbs.

      such as surgery and health analzyers. Report if anything seems wrong

      to the new (cargo accessible) Beacon implant.

      Management Console.

      :cl:'

      it. Also correctly sets the holder temperature to 20 kelvin & causes reactions
      when first made
2023-12-13:
  Melbert:
  - bugfix: When using an item on a mob, you will always attempt to fix wounds AFTER
      surgery, BUT BEFORE the item's own interactions. As an example, this means using
      a mesh on a mob will attempt to progress surgery first, then attempt to fix
      any burn wounds, then heal burn damage.
  Rhials:
  - bugfix: Sunset Saloon virtual domain should no longer sometimes spawn with holes
      in the floor.

      xenomorph tackles and body throws.
  - balance: The double-energy sword and energy sword have trouble blocking physical
      projectiles, body throws and tackles.
  - balance: The double-energy sword also no longer has guaranteed energy projectile
      deflection; only doing so on a successful block (75% chance to block).
  - balance: But it does have 40 force now, so it is more lethal a weapon. Traitors
      can purchase the sword for only 13 TC (down from 16 TC).
  - balance: The combat energy shield (The one you hold) now functions as a normal
      shield (it used to only protect you against energy projectiles and nothing else).
      It loses guaranteed energy projectile deflection, but still reflects the projectile
      so on a block.
  - balance: The MODsuit shield module only has one charge, but recharges every 10
      seconds. It also costs 8 TC (down from 15). It is also now in the Core Gear
