  - rscadd: Nanotrasen has started tracking exactly how often you're blowing up the
      supermatter engine. Surely they can't be sending as many new crystals over there

      lose all your blood and die forever.

      on a surgery table: the corresponding blood type should no longer report it
      as if the patient in question had a Rhesus blood type, and will instead declare
      the name of the actual reagent circulating within their system.'

      contents if it fails to attach the limb.
  - refactor: Cleanbots have been entirely reworked, please report any bugs you might
      find.
  - rscadd: Heretics can no longer be converted to cult. But sacrificing them is very
      valuable to Nar'Sie, and she will grant special weapons if you manage to do
      so.

  - bugfix: Wizard's anonymous event won't run near the start of a round anymore.
