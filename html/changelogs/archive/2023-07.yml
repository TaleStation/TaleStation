  TaleStationBot:

  - rscadd: Coroners are now Morbid!
  - rscadd: Coroners come with a series of special tools that are especially good
      at performing certain surgeries if used by a Morbid individual (which the coroner
      happens to be). They are found in the coroner's medkit.
  - rscadd: The sorts of surgeries they enjoy are; dissections, autospies, revival
      surgery, plastic surgery, organ/feature manipulations, amputations. Also eyesnatching.
  - rscadd: Coroners therefore hate; tending the wounds of the living, defibrillation
      and CPR. Why waste so much effort on breathers if you can't even carve them
      up a bit first?
  - rscadd: Coroners love pickles and pickle juice.
  - rscadd: The coroner can finally put their autopsy scanner into their special medkit.
      Not the compact one, though.

  - rscadd: Food and pills have a 10% chance to infect with one of three new diseases

      structures (Considered as tables for pills). Made harvest spawn on top of hydrotrays
      to stay protected from germs.
  - rscadd: 'Added three new advanced diseases: Gastritium, Carpellosis, Nebula Nausea
      with static cures obtained by digesting dirty food.'
  - bugfix: Food no longer decomposes on Hydrotrays, Grilles, Bonfires and all dense
      kitchen machinery
  - code_imp: Decomposition now uses `germ_sensitive` component and follows 5 second
      rule too.
  - qol: Crafted food items spawns on nearby tables (except the one behind you) instead
      of dropping on floor when hands are full.
  - qol: Add hotkeys to APCs for AIs and borgs. Toggle environmental (ctrl + shift),
      toggle lighting (shift), toggle equipment (alt), and toggle breaker (ctrl).
  - qol: Remove APC UI popup when using RMB to toggle the lock.
  - bugfix: jetpack modules work on mod suits again
  - bugfix: jetpack cyber implants also work
  - refactor: removed `get_mover` callback, user is retrieved during activation

      organ damage, blood level, and/or suffocation damage depending on the targeted
      area.
  - rscadd: Shining flashlights into the mouth or eyes of other players will additionally
      assess brain health, suffocation damage, and/or blood level depending on the
      targeted area.
  - balance: Halves the duration of the flash effect from shining lights into players'
      eyes (2s -> 1s). Use combat mode to get the full duration.

      spawning gear in them (job shit and all)
  - bugfix: Fixed the office chair being silent. My bad.
  Vekter:
  - balance: Increased armor penetration on xenos' neurotoxin spit. Well-protected
      crew members should still take more than a few hits to down but shouldn't be
      immune to it.
