# JollyStation Icons and YOU!
Most of the information about adding, removing and modifying icons can be found in the JollyStation_modules folder's README.md.

## Before porting, read the following:
Most of the sprites in this codebase are free to use, as it is with most /TG/ downstreams. However, some users may *request* sprites be specifically made for the codebase, and have them commissioned. This following section will denote PRs where this is true. We ask users wishing to port this content to get in contact with the PR author. We hold no right to stop you, the user, from grabbing these sprites and using them yourself. But we ask simply for you to reach out to us first. It would be greatly appreciated!

- #284 - Resprites of Item Dispensers - Commissioned by Jolly from Gofawful5 
- #411 - Fax Machine Sprites - Commissioned by Jolly from Imaginos (PositiveEntropy)
