//These are basically just the floor tiles chopped up as tile decals so you can mix and match them.
//I wish I could greyscale these, but im fairly certain I cant as the actual turfs would be greyscaled if that was a possiblity anyways.
//They're still organized to be easily greyscaled in the future, if possible.
//Also TG would deny this for some reason. I dont even know why, I guess they're just opposed to better detailed maps? That's why this is downstream and not upstream.
